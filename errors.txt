over the past_few_weeks i have become aware of what a pain vandalism is this is obvious_vandalism vulgarity mostly but also sneakily changing dates to nonsense inserting persons own names etc also i find the editor bizarre it s the worse of both html and not html it s great the you can select a word and make it italics for example but to translate this into a bunch of quote_marks is an editing nightmare after that frankly_i_think all that stuff should_be hidden from the user something that is bolded and italicized is just a mess of serial quote_marks six i_think i_guess that i_am off in another direction on your editing philosophy since i_don_t understand it further i find the way that users document and have quot talk quot inconsistent someone unknowingly reverted my_edits i went round and round just trying to communicate to him that i thought this was wrong finally i stumbled_onto it but have_been unable to duplicate my quot stumble quot since then later i found that he had admitted his error but it it a nightmare to use so in summary i find the whole quot back office quot portion of wikipedia an arcane mess i realize this is a volunteer effort so you should_be applauded for that but i_think while keeping the article content in tact you need to re_evaluate how casual editors use the system and make that process easier there is a wealth of knowledge out there that i fear is not being shared because the editing revision process i d like to use for my entire bibliography at the top of an article and then use as i need to throughout the article and finally have include everything that i have at the top it would be nice if it was everything that i cited but it s okay if not is there a way i can hide such a section from the top of an article december_utc

the way they were supposed to the last few_days they don_t_seem to be working at all am i the only one with this problem november_utc why is it that fa are marked appropriately in the top right_hand_corner but ga are not december_utc oh right well i was thinking of creating just such a template i take it there s no point december_utc_hello could i safely revert t square_ software back to tocleft until this is resolved i thought tocleft was fine and put more information above the fold and used it in alexander_kronrod but don_t_want to cause problems thank_you in advance december_utc

without my clicking log out my account is inexplicably logged out sometimes without my even having turned off my computer or closed my_browser i usually use firefox and i have to log on again several_times it happened while i was in process of making an edit and left the computer for a while and when i returned and completed the edit and signed and saved it the edit was signed by my_ip_address not my signature which is aggravating has something changed here is there a setting that i inadvertently deactivated is anyone_else having the problem if it s a firefox setting would_appreciate hearing how to fix it and is there any way to get those ip_address edits changed to show my account name thanks_december_utc i was thinking that it would be very exciting if we had a quot hide autoconfirmed_users quot button at most of our a g g business comes from brand_new users so this would be a really_neat way of identifying that what do people think can anyone help_me open a bug for this if_you think it s sensibel and feasible december_utc i was directed here from the irc_channel after unsuccesfully trying to resolve this issue there i signed up for an account a couple of days_ago but something in the signup process appears to have caused the account to become messed_up i d prefer to not just create a new account because it took me quite some time to find a username which wasn_t taken or was too close to an existing name without tacking on random_numbers the process went as follows i created the account name mrjamesgurney with case as specified i received an address confirmation_email and clicked on the link and was told that my email had been validated now when i try to login i_m told the password is incorrect it s conceivable that i typed my_password wrong twice in a row but it s not something i_ve_done in a very long time regardless the password is supposedly wrong so instead i click the e_mail new password button whereupon i_m told quot there is no e_mail_address recorded for user quot which can_t be true because i_ve received the email confirmation_email and clicked the verify link and been told my address has_been verified so obviously something has become messed_up with the account and rather_than simply create a new one is there some way the status can_be reset so that i can actually use this account i can if necessary forward the confirmation_email with full headers to indicate the connection_between the username and my_email_address the preceding_comment was added by december_utc can someone help out a newbie i_ve consulted the but it does_not_seem to explain_why the caption is not displaying the preceding_comment was added by december_utc_i_ve been getting little square boxes all over the place for months now the kind of boxes that mean that you_re missing a font or some such technicala problem and the computer doesn_t_know_how to read them however my particular line of editing means i have to be able to read them so does_anyone_know what font i need or what i need to do to get them to go away for instance i can_t read three of the symbols now if i type in some of the special characters on the bar under the

how_does one fix this december_utc i edit an article and make some changes i then invoke search to check_whether a term in is wp so i can wikify it if appropriate i then return back to the article i_am editing i find that my_edits are lost the only way to prevent this loss of edits is to do a preview before i do my search my_question is is wp editor supposed to losing edits in this way or is

article that i_think have_been well received as i monitor the article over the past_few_weeks i have become aware of what a pain vandalism is this is obvious_vandalism vulgarity mostly but also sneakily changing dates to nonsense inserting persons own names etc also i find the editor bizarre it s the worse of both html and not html it s great the you can select a word and make it italics for example but to translate this into a bunch of quote_marks is an editing nightmare after that frankly_i_think all that stuff should_be hidden from the user something that is bolded and italicized is just a mess of serial quote_marks six i_think i_guess that i_am off in another direction on your editing philosophy since i_don_t understand it further i find the way that users document and have quot talk quot inconsistent someone unknowingly reverted my_edits i went round and round just trying to communicate to him that i thought this was wrong finally i stumbled_onto it but have_been unable to duplicate my quot stumble quot since then later i found that he had admitted his error but it it a nightmare to use so in summary i find the whole quot back office quot portion of wikipedia an arcane mess i realize this is a volunteer effort so you should_be applauded for that but i_think while keeping the article content in tact you need to re_evaluate how casual editors use the system and make that process easier there is a wealth of knowledge out there that i fear is not being shared because the editing revision process i d like to use for my entire bibliography at the top of an article and then use as i need to throughout the article and finally have include everything that i have at the top it would be nice if it was everything that i cited but it s okay if not is there a way i can hide such a section from the top of an article december_utc thanks in advance december_utc thanks i have a few things in my_monobook that i_ve copied from here and there that are supposed to customize one s wikipedia experience somehow they used to work just the way they were supposed to the last few_days they don_t_seem to be working at all am i the only one with this problem november_utc why is it that fa are marked appropriately in the top right_hand_corner but ga are not december_utc oh right well i was thinking of creating just such a template i take it there s no point december_utc_hello could i safely revert t square_ software back to tocleft until this is resolved i thought tocleft was fine and put more information above the fold and used it in alexander_kronrod but don_t_want to cause problems thank_you in advance december_utc for months my account would stay logged on unless i deliberately clicked on quot log out quot even when i turned off my computer that is how i_want it to work however suddenly in the last few_days without my clicking log out my account is inexplicably logged out sometimes without my even having turned off my computer or closed my_browser i usually use firefox and i have to log on again several_times it happened while i was in process of making an edit and left the computer for a while and when i returned and completed the edit and signed and saved it the edit was signed by my_ip_address not my signature which is aggravating has something changed here is there a setting that i inadvertently deactivated is anyone_else having the problem if it s a firefox setting would_appreciate hearing how to fix it and is there any way to get those ip_address edits changed to show my account name thanks_december_utc i was thinking that it would be very exciting if we had a quot hide autoconfirmed_users quot button at most of our a g g business comes from brand_new users so this would be a really_neat way of identifying that what do people think can anyone help_me open a bug for this if_you think it s sensibel and feasible december_utc i was directed here from the irc_channel after unsuccesfully trying to resolve this issue there i signed up for an account a couple of days_ago but something in the signup process appears to have caused the account to become messed_up i d prefer to not just create a new account because it took me quite some time to find a username which wasn_t taken or was too close to an existing name without tacking on random_numbers the process went as follows i created the account name mrjamesgurney with case as specified i received an address confirmation_email and clicked on the link and was told that my email had been validated now when i try to login i_m told the password is incorrect it s conceivable that i typed my_password wrong twice in a row but it s not something i_ve_done in a very long time regardless the password is supposedly wrong so instead i click the e_mail new password button whereupon i_m told quot there is no e_mail_address recorded for user quot which can_t be true because i_ve received the email confirmation_email and clicked the verify link and been told my address has_been verified so obviously something has become messed_up with the account and rather_than simply create a new one is there some way the status can_be reset so that i can actually use this account i can if necessary forward the confirmation_email with full headers to indicate the connection_between the username and my_email_address the preceding_comment was added by december_utc can someone help out a newbie i_ve consulted the but it does_not_seem to explain_why the caption is not displaying the preceding_comment was added by december_utc_i_ve been getting little square boxes all over the place for months now the kind of boxes that mean that you_re missing a font or some such technicala problem and the computer doesn_t_know_how to read them however my particular line of editing means i have to be able to read them so does_anyone_know what font i need or what i need to do to get them to go away for instance i can_t read three of the symbols now if i type in some of the special characters on the bar under the text box i_m typing in now i get quot \xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\xa5\xe1\xb8\xa5\xe1\xb8\xb7\xe1\xb8\xb7\xe1\xb8\xb9\xe1\xb8\xb9\xe1\xb9\x83\xe1\xb9\x83\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\x9d\xe1\xb9\x9d\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1 quot which will either look perfectly_normal to you because your font works or it ll look totally_wrong to you because your font doesn_t work that s exactly_what i_m seeing if that made any sense how_does one fix this december_utc i edit an article and make some changes i then invoke search to check_whether a term in is wp so i can wikify it if appropriate i then return back to the article i_am editing i find that my_edits are lost the only way to prevent this loss of edits is to do a preview before i do my search my_question is is wp editor supposed to losing edits in this way or is this a software_bug that can should_be fixed december_utc currently the templates like use wiki_markup for formatting but shouldn_t this really be likewise for other built in or quot meta quot messages december_utc how do i cite an image taken from wikipedia http_en_wikipedia_org wiki image charles_de_gaulle jpg if suppose i cite as wikipedia charles_de_gaulle jpg typing the same into the search bar wont take me to the image help i need help from someone well_versed in advanced wikimarkup parser_functions and css this template is pretty_much a version of http_en_wikipedia_org wiki template infobox_animanga header with variables to control the colors if i set the cor_fundo_titulo variable to any css color it works fine however if i_don_t set the variable it should default to ccf
